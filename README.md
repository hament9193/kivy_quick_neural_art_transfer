# Quick-Neural-Art-Transfer
Theano/Lasagne based Neural artistic style transfer with Kivy GUI

based on https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/tree/master/examples/styletransfer an implementation of the algorithm described in "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Gatys, Ecker and Bethge. 

use VGG19 model http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/
(
```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/lasagne/recipes/pretrained/imagenet/vgg19_normalized.pkl ```
to get the pickled file)

Several modification are made to speed up the process. 
1. Doing the transfer in pyramid manner to speed up and seems generating better results.
2. Has an option to use ADAM as the optimizer.
3. Use shared memory and can precompile theanot functions. 
4. Has a server and a Kivy GUI client, so you can capture image using a mobile device and the use the GPU on a remote machine.
Usage:
```python
import neuralStyle as ns
import cv2
ns.precompute() # compile theano functions
for x in ns.p_transfer("photo.jpg", "art.jpg"):
  cv2.imshow("output", x)
```

or you can use ```nstest.py photo.jpg art1.jpg art2.jpg art3.jpg``` to test it.

## Demo program

The demo program with kivy UI is designed for an exhibition, which takes user's input from webcam and rendered it with a style.

The program expect an gpu of gtx 980 or better. To run this program, you will need a gpu at least as powerful as gtx 965m.
If your gpu is slower, than you will need to chang zmq.RCVTIMEO to  a larger value(more than 15 seconds)
First run the server, 
```
python nserver.py 
```
you will need to wait a while it for theano function to be compiled, it may take up to 2 minutes.
Then you can run the kivy client. it requires a webcam and cv2 installed.
Then you can run the client
```
python main.py
```
